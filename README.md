# LocalHarvest (KisanMart)

## Inspiration
Growing up in India, we know what it's like to be a farmer here & by extension, around the globe. As someone whose relatives are farmers as well, I know what the struggles can be like. Farmers globally work tirelessly day & night to support their families, yet due to the shady tactics of middlemen & consumers not being aware, they lose out on the profit. Millions of farmers worldwide are suffering as a result, so we knew we had to create a solution.

## What it does
LocalHarvest offers farmers a platform to sell their products directly to consumers. Consumers can log in & see a variety of options. They can search by product, or they can search by farmers. They can click on farmers' profiles to see their history & a complete list of their products. Farmers can set their rates, update their stock, see their analytics, & manage everything through a dashboard. Users can purchase products directly on the app as well. This way, farmers skip the middlemen & keep more of the profit, while users pay less overall as they avoid the inflation tactics of middlemen & are ensured that their food is fresh & clean.

## How we built it
We built LocalHarvest using a variety of tools, including Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Figma, Gemini, etc. We started by designing the application and its layout on Figma. LocalHarvest was a two-layered application as it catered to both consumers and farmers. Firebase was a great option for managing the backend of the application as it provides authentication, storage, and a database in the form of Firebase Firestore. We also used Gemini to add an AI touch to the application. Flutter, with the Dart programming language, enabled us to create a cross-platform application. This project showcases the past three years of software development skills I’ve gained with Flutter.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into some challenges with design. We spent a lot of time on Figma mockups to ensure that we had the best UX product & the app was the easiest-to-use possible for both farmers & buyers. We also had some struggles trying to code such a thorough application, but through persistent hard work, we were able to overcome this. We kept thinking of the farmers we could help and the people we could alleviate out of poverty, which served as great motivation.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating something truly impactful. As this is something so close to home, it feels like we’re truly giving back to our families & communities. I’ve always wanted to work on a product that is both technically challenging & has a massive community impact, so this project was a perfect opportunity. We’re especially proud of the hard work we put in, as we were able to build this platform in such little time.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about design & frontend development. We explored many new tools & overcame challenges related to database integration. Throughout the journey, we watched tutorials, read manuals, & gained new skills. It was a great learning experience overall.

## What's next for LocalHarvest
### A LOT
We plan to make this the real deal. We want to launch this soon to farmers & consumers, making the platform widely accessible. We'll be looking to partner with local governments & non-profit organizations to get this project rolling. Additionally, we aim to expand this worldwide, starting with regions like the USA, Canada, & India. Our mission is to help farmers & create a win-win situation for both farmers and consumers, and we won’t stop until we’ve achieved this.
